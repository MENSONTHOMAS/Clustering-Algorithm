## How K-Means Clustering Works

K-Means is an unsupervised clustering algorithm that groups data into K clusters. It works as follows:
- Initialization: Randomly select K cluster centroids.
- Assignment Step: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.
- Update Step: Compute new centroids as the mean of points in each cluster.
- Repeat: Steps 2 and 3 until centroids do not change significantly or reach a stopping condition.


## Why K-Means is Suitable for the Iris Dataset

- The Iris dataset contains three natural classes (setosa, versicolor, virginica), which makes it a good candidate for clustering.
- K-Means assumes clusters are spherical and well-separated, which approximates the structure of the Iris dataset.
- It is computationally efficient and works well with moderate-sized datasets like Iris.


## How Hierarchical Clustering Works

Hierarchical clustering builds a hierarchy of clusters either through:
### Agglomerative (Bottom-Up) Approach:
- Starts with each data point as its own cluster.
- Merges the closest clusters iteratively until one cluster remains.
### Divisive (Top-Down) Approach:
- Starts with a single cluster containing all data points.
- Recursively splits clusters into smaller clusters until each point is its own cluster.

## Why Hierarchical Clustering is Suitable for the Iris Dataset

- The **Iris dataset** has a natural hierarchical structure with three species, making it a good candidate for hierarchical clustering.
- **Dendrograms** provide insight into the relationships between data points and can help determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Unlike K-Means, hierarchical clustering does not require specifying the number of clusters beforehand (though a cutoff can be applied).
